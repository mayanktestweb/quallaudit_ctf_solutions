# QuillCTF : Private Club

## Object of CTF
In this CTF hacker is given 10 ethers and he asked to (1) become member of club, (2) block further registeration by exhausting gas Limit and (3) Withdraw all ethers from private club.

## Vulnerability Of Private Club Smart Contract
Vulnerability of Smart Contract lies in the fact that it's allowing users to send the list of members along with the transaction.

    function becomeMember(
        address[] calldata _members
    ) external payable nonReentrant {
    
So this should be list of users who are already members of club and new user will also have to send ethers equal to the number of members so that each member can get 1 ether on your admission. Now of course, hacker can send an array of with his own address. The length of this array is ofcourse going to be equal to total number of members. This way during the transaction all Eths will come back to hacker's own address during transaction. Also hacker can do it, again and again for **10 - totalNumberOfMembers**. This will exhaust all block gas and future registrations wont be possible.

Since, hacker has not yet spent any Ethers and still have 10 ETHs, he can use it to buy admin role and withdraw all tokens.
